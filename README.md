## homework-3

Javascript is really an exercise in frustration. The previous time I studied it, I would get confused by the logic behind how to create what I needed to in the html, so when I encountered the same issue again, I wasn't surprised. I was able to understand the simple aspect behind getting a password to generate, as I can understand the use of math.random function, which we used in our rock paper scissors demo. However, the challenge was making this work for a password value that would be determined by what criteria the user selected. At first, I could get my prompts to work as intended, along with creating an array with the different characters for each criteria (symbols, numbers, etc.), but it was creating the rest of my generate password function that I struggled with. Perusing resources on the web and in my activites, I was able to see many different ways of using conditional statments, and found that while statements could really work with pushing the user throught a series of prompts. I used a great resource in Tiffany Casey's work at https://github.com/TiffanyCasey/Password-Generator.git. I want to make clear that her code is referenced in my work, so that any similarites are due to it helping clear up my difficluties with my generate password function.

## Motivation

I knew this was going to be tough, so I'm just glad I was able to get an understnding of what the assignment required.

When you hit the generate password button, a series of prompts will ask the user to enter how long they want their passwrod to be, and to include different characters. The resulting password will be displayed in the text area.

## Installation
Pretty simple to deploy this, simply cut and paste the url into you preferred browser. No need to download.
